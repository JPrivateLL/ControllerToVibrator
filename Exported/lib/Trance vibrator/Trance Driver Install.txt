This document explains what is necessary to get a Trance Vibrator running
with OpenVibrations on Windows.

1) Install libusb-win32 filter driver

You will need a copy of libusb-win32 to use trance-vibrator.exe on Windows.
You can find out more at http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/, but it boils
down to downloading libusb-win32-filter-bin-0.1.12.1.exe from sourceforge:

   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/libusb-win32/libusb-win32-filter-bin-0.1.12.1.exe?modtime=1174387137&big_mirror=0

Now install it, accepting any defaults it may present.

2) Connect the Trance and install its drivers

Connect your Trance Vibrator to your computer.  When prompted for drivers,
browse to the location of drmn_trance.ini. usually C:\Documents and Settings\user\ovics-0.8.8\ovd\trance.

As part of the installation you'll be asked to provide two additional files -
libusb0.sys and libusb0.dll.  They're a part of the libusb-win32-filter you
installed in the previous step, so when asked for these files, browse
to these locations since they're already on your computer:

c:\windows\system32\drivers\libusb0.sys
c:\windows\system32\libusb0.dll

You should now be ready to use your Trance on your computer.
